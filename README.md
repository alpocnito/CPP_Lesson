# OpenFIleDialog
The main goal of project is to learn how inheritance in C++ works and is to write code using inheritance.

OpenFIleDialog can open directories, demonstrate the files in directory.

I used MVC model, where 
+ Model + View is: AWindow, AButton
+ Control is: AWindowC, ButtonC

Project is based on SFML library
